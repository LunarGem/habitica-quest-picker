# Habitica Quest Picker

Have a lot of quests but don't know which to do next? This tool aids Habitica parties in choosing their next quest. To run, just click the web link (make sure you know how to get Habitica UUIDs).

## Built With

* HTML/CSS
* JS
* [Materialize Design Library](http://materializecss.com/) - *web design framework (makes things pretty)*

## Contributing

If you can develop in JS already, you probably know everything you need to (and likely more than I do). Ask about an issue/feature implementation! If you can't, please submit bugs/feature requests! Tell me what I can do to make it better/prettier/easier to use.

## Versioning

I'll try to use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. Hopefully after the alpha release things won't get pushed to master if they're not ready.
